Doctor Appointment Booking System - Implementation Steps

1. Project Overview
This is a full-stack web application that allows users to:

View a list of available doctors
Book an appointment with a doctor
Get a confirmation after booking

2. Technologies Used

Frontend: React, React Router, Bootstrap, Axios
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Data Storage: JSON files (mock database)
Styling: Bootstrap & CSS
Form Validation: Formik & Yup

3. Backend Implementation

Step 1: Setting Up the Backend
Create a backend folder and initialize a Node.js project.
Install dependencies: express, cors, and dotenv.

Step 2: Setting Up the Server
Use Express.js to create a server (server.js).
Enable CORS and JSON parsing.
Set up API routes for doctors and appointments.

Step 3: Creating API Routes
Doctor Routes (doctorRoutes.js): Fetch the list of doctors from doctors.json.
Appointment Routes (appointmentRoutes.js): Handle appointment booking requests.

Step 4: Storing Data in JSON
Store doctor details like name, specialty, and available slots in a doctors.json file.

Step 5: Running the Backend
Start the server using node server.js.
Test API endpoints using Postman or a browser.

4. Frontend Implementation
Step 1: Setting Up React
Create a frontend folder and initialize a React project.
Install dependencies:
react-router-dom (for navigation)
axios (for API calls)
bootstrap & react-bootstrap (for styling)

Step 2: Configuring Routes (App.js)
Define routes for:
Home Page → Displays the list of doctors.
Booking Page → Lets users enter details and book an appointment.
Confirmation Page → Shows booking confirmation.

Step 3: Creating Components
Doctor List (DoctorList.js)
Fetches doctor data from the backend (/api/doctors).
Displays doctor details.
Allows users to select a doctor to book an appointment.
Booking Form (BookingForm.js)
Collects name, email, date, and time for the appointment.
Fetches available time slots from the backend.
Submits the booking request.
Redirects to the confirmation page after booking.
Confirmation Page (Confirmation.js)
Displays user details after booking.
Shows a success message.
Provides a Home button for navigation.

5. Styling the Application
Bootstrap is added for a responsive UI.
Components use container, card, and button classes for better design.

6. Running the Application
1. Start the Backend

cd backend
node server.js
Server runs at http://localhost:5000.

2. Start the Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
React app runs at http://localhost:3000.

3. Testing the Application
Open http://localhost:3000.
Select a doctor and book an appointment.
Verify the confirmation page shows entered details.

7. Summary
This project provides a fully functional doctor appointment system with React and Node.js. It follows REST API principles, includes Bootstrap styling, and offers a smooth user experience.
